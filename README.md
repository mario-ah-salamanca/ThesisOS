# About 
The linux operating system is one of the most popular operating system(OS) nowdays, however it has become too complex for teaching OS fundamentals. Furthermore there has been a push for using Rust instead of C for writting more robust OS kernels. 
The goal of this project is to investigate recent Educational Operating Systems with a specific focus in Rust.
# Building
